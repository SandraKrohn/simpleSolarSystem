# simpleSolarSystem
<p>
  Super simple solar system simulation (: Made following a tutorial by TechWithTim, so all credit goes to him.
</p>

This program is neither interactive nor does it show detailed information. It just shows some planets orbiting the sun, using the actuall distance and mass in scale.

<p>
  The only changes I made are displaying the planet names instead of their distance from the sun and adding Jupiter.
 
  <br>The comments in the code are rather for my own understanding than for general explanation of what's happening since I'm still a beginner.
